- for now, ignore everying in /components
- obviously, not testing /assets, /config




- for models, lots of testing to be done, but arguably a lower priority
- definitely test lots of the helping functions in /models/Conversion

- /models/utils, we want to test pretty much everying, maybe except DepInj. 

- /models/enums/Timeframe, bunch of functions we should test



- we're gonna need to mock the Firestore object --> primary dependency of like every service
- we're gonna need to mock the imageService, userService ( dependency of authService)
        I would probably do auth service last (don't even think we can? )

- we have to look into mocking the Firestore client SDK and what that entails, 
        specifically can we pass mocks into the SDKs functions or do we need to mock those functions?
